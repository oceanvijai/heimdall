# The Swift OpenCV Framework

This framework wants to let developer use `Swift` to access `OpenCV` library,

Due to the fact that `OpenCV` is wrote in `C++`, if someone want to use it by `Swift`,

it needs to be access through `Objective-C` wrapper.

However, it is not easy for noobs to use both `Swift` and `Objective-C`, especially for Objective-C, which syntax is very different from others.

So I'm want to build this framework for who want to access the `OpneCV` API on the iOS platform by `Swift`.


And the main job of this framework is to wrap the `C++` class by `Objective-C`, then through bridge header, others can use it by `Swift`.
